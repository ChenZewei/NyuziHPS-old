This benchmark approximates the workload of Bitcoin hashing.  It performs 
parallel SHA-256 hashes, with one hash instance per vector lane.  It utilizes 
multiple hardware threads, so there are 64 hashes active per core.  

This only runs in Verilog simulation.  You can execute it by typing:

    ./runtest.sh
