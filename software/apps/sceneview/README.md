This is a viewer for [Wavefront .OBJ files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file). 
It uses the 3D engine in librender. Run it in the emulator by typing:

    make run

To run on FPGA, set the ENABLE_RAMDISK macro in libos/fs.c, rebuild, and do a
clean rebuild in this directory. Once everything is built, type 'make fpgarun'
to execute. The makefile will transfer the data files over the serial port 
into a ramdisk in memory. This will take a while.

The makefile invokes the 'make_resource_py.py' script. This reads the OBJ file 
and associated textures and writes out 'resource.bin', which the viewer program
loads. The MODEL_FILE variable in the makefile selects which OBJ file to read. 
If the model does not contain normals, the script computes them.

The Sponza model is from this repository:

http://graphics.cs.williams.edu/data/meshes.xml

To view other models, extract the data files to a new directory.  Change 
MODEL_FILE in the Makefile to point at the OBJ file for the new model. 
Delete `resource.bin` and type `make run` again. You may need to change the 
modelViewMatrix in viewobj.cpp to put the camera in the right place.
The first parameter is the position of the camera.  The second is a point in
space that the camera is looking at. The third is a vector that points up.

    Matrix modelViewMatrix = Matrix::lookAt(Vec3(-10, 2, 0), Vec3(15, 8, 0), Vec3(0, 1, 0));

Complex models may exceed the working memory limit in librender, which  
causes an assertion:

    ASSERT FAILED: ./SliceAllocator.h:60: alignedAlloc + size < fArenaBase + fTotalSize

Changing the parameter constructor to the RenderContext allocates more 
memory:

    RenderContext *context = new RenderContext(0x1000000);

There are a few debug defines in the top of sceneview.cpp:
- **TEST_TEXTURE** If defined, this uses a checkerboard texture in place 
of the normal textures. Each mip level is a different color. 
- **SHOW_DEPTH** If defined, this shades the pixels with lighter values 
representing closer depth values and darker representing farther ones.

### Running in Verilog Simulation

In order to measure the performance of rendering one frame in simulation, you need to make
the following changes:

1. At the bottom of the main loop in sceneview.cpp, add a call to exit(). This stop the main
loop, and will also cause the worker threads to terminate:

         		context->finish();
         		printf("rendered frame in %d instructions\n", __builtin_nyuzi_read_control_reg(6) 
         			- startInstructions);
        +		exit(1);
         	}
 	
     	return 0;

2. Increase the size of the virtual SDMMC device to fit the resource files. In rtl/testbench/sim_sdmmc.sv,
change MAX_BLOCK_DEVICE_SIZE to 'h2000000 (32 MB)

3. Increase the amount of RAM configured in the FPGA configuration. In rtl/testbench/verilator_tb.sv,
change MEM_SIZE to 'h3000000 (48 MB)

4. Type make in the rtl directory to rebuild the verilator model

Once you've made these changes, you can run the test by typing 'make verirun'.
