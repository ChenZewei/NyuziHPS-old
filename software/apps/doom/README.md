This is a port of DOOM to the Nyuzi architecture. Although it doesn't use
features like vector arithmetic or hardware threading, it is a good test of the
toolchain, as it is fairly large (50k lines of code, compiled to 300k binary).

This requires a shareware WAD file. This is not included in this repository, 
but you can find it with a Google search. Name it "DOOM1.WAD" (all uppercase) 
and put it in this directory.

To run in the emulator, type 'make run'.

To run on FPGA, change libos to use the ramdisk by setting the ENABLE_RAMDISK
macro in software/libs/libos/fs.c. Rebuild libos and type 'make fpgarun' 
in this directory to execute. The makefile transfers the data files over the 
serial port into the ramdisk. This takes a while.

The primary changes I made for the port were:

* in i_video.c, added code to copy the screen to the framebuffer, expanding
  from an 8 bit paletted format to the 32 bit per pixel framebuffer format. 
* in i_video.c, read from a virtual keyboard device for input. 
* W_CheckNumForName assumed support for unaligned accesses. Changed to 
  use memcmp.
* Code from i_net and i_sound removed, since there's no hardware support 
  for them.
